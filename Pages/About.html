            <h2><u>Background</u></h2>

            <p My name is J. Pryor Lindsey. <br>
                I go by Pryor or JP. <br> My name is somewhat confusing for people when they first meet me, since I essentially have 3 first names, <br> 3 middle names, and 3 last names. Over the years, I've answered to a lot of different names. <br>                This is just a partial list:
                <ul>
                    <li>John Pryor</li>
                    <li>Lindsey Pryor</li>
                    <li>John Lindsey</li>
                    <li>Pryor John</li>
                    <li>PJ</li>
                    <li>Prior</li>
                    <li>Bryar</li>
                    <li>Brian</li>
                    <li>Dryer</li>

                </ul><br> I 'm what's known as a GenXer. This means that I am at home with the latest technology, but I also know how to use a rotary phone. I've been working in the manufacturing industry for almost 30 years, first in IT at a major manufacturer
                of airplane wings, next managing factory maintenance,<br> then to project management. Now, after nearly 12 years of project management,
                <br> I've been asked to return to my IT roots. I have to say, it is exciting!</p>
            <hr <p>Over the years, I've had several hobbies. My first love was martial arts. <br> I started when I was 12 and continued well into my adult years. I <br> even got my wife taking classes with me for a while. Throughout those same years, <br> I
            spent alot of time in the gym, lifting weights. When I hit my forties, I changed <br> course and began triathlons. I've completed over a dozen triathlons, two <br> dozen running events, mostly half marathons, and one marathon. Of course
            <br> it's not all physical, I enjoy bingeing home improvement shows, crime dramas <br> and science fiction. Oddly, computers were never a hobby. For me, it's always <br> been a job, albeit, one that I love.
